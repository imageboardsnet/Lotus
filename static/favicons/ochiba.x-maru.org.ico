<h1>Ochiba Sandbox</h1>
<p>This is a sandbox demonstrating ochiba used in "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard">image board</a>" mode (the default). If you're not familiar with image boards, they are a place where people can post images and discuss them. No user accounts are necessary, it's open to all. Generally, images are organized by category ("boards").</p>

<p><strong>Please keep your posts SAFE FOR WORK</strong>. No nudity, extreme violence or gore, or similar material. Also, please do not post copyrighted material here. This is a sandbox provided to try out ochiba in image board mode - posts may be deleted without warning.</p>

<p>If you'd like to try the posting process, try submitting an image to <a href="sandbox">/sandbox</a> by clicking the "Post" link above.</p>

<p>If you have pictures of fallen leaves, please post them to <a href="ochiba">/ochiba</a>.</p>

<p><a href="screenshots">/screenshots</a> is for posting pictures of ochiba in action, whether to show off your installation or to report problems (please follow up with a post in <a href="/support/">the support board</a> if you are having problems).</p>

<p><a href="cooking">/cooking</a> is for images of cooking stuff.</p>

<h2>/numbers</h2>
<p>
This is blatant rip-off of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/numerical/pool/">In Numerical Order Pool</a> at Flickr - post photographs of numbers, in sequence. I thought the idea was pretty neat (reminded me of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092929/">Drowning By Numbers</a> - good movie!) so I decided to implement something like that in ochiba.
</p>
<p>
It could've done a variety of different ways, using various ochiba tricks. It could've been done as a single thread in one of the categories. However, once this got large enough, then it would've caused problems since the pager only paginates based on threads, not images within threads.
</p>
<p>
It could've been done by keywords (tags). That requires some effort on the poster to tag appropriately, but otherwise would've worked OK.
</p>
<p>
Or, create its own category for it. Which is what I decided to do. I set the category default sort order to "desc" so the most recent number appears first.
</p>
<p>
Feel free to join in and "play" this game. Here are some guidelines to make it more fun for everyone:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be a photo of a "naturally" found number. No screenshots. No creating numbers yourself.</li>
<li>One number per thread.</li>
<li>If you think you have a better representation of a number already posted, post it as the reply to the thread.</li>
<li>No numbers from any source that inherently has numbers in sequence, such as page numbers, elevator buttons, telephones, etc. A general rule of thumb: if you can get more than one entry without having to walk anywhere, it's no good.</li>
<li>Post only numbers in isolation. Cropping a larger number to get only the digits you want is no fun - for example, taking a picture of "2005" and cropping out the "05" to make "20" is no good.</li>
<li>Only Arabic numerals. No Roman numerals, or other number forms, no spelled out numbers, no dots, etc.</li>
<li>A set of digits separated from other digits by a hyphen/dash, other letters, or other punctuation is OK.</li>
<li>A decimal point or comma is not counted in the above and is considered "invisible". So, "1.99" can not be used for "1" or "99". It is "199".</li>
<li>Zero padding on the left is OK</li>
</ul>
